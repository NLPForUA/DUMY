### Usage and License Notices: 
 - Exam tasks are CC BY NC 4.0 (allowing only non-commercial use) and models trained using that subset should not be used outside of research purposes.
 - LLM outputs (predictions and thoughts) are Apache 2.0 licensed. **Note, however, that you can not use that data to build competing solutions according to model providers ToS (except for DeepSeek).**
 - Repo code is Apache 2.0 licensed.

# Updates:
### - Stay tuned

# Description
This dataset includes:

1. ~4000 exam questions from the ZNO-Eval benchmark across multiple domains:
   - Ukrainian language and literature
   - Mathematics
   - History of Ukraine
   - Geography

2. Thousands of programming tasks, each with a Python solution. Each task is enhanced with chain-of-thought samples generated by leading instruction-following models, making DUMY suitable for:

- Distillation of LLMs

- GRPO or standard fine-tuning

- Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning research

- Evaluation of multilingual and low-resource reasoning capabilities

All examples, thoughts, and model generations are openly licensed (non-commercial use), with references to the original problem sources where required.
